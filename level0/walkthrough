- We started debugging the binary file with gdb.

$> gdb level0

- Set a breakpoint at main and run.

gdb> break main
gdb> run

- Step through instructions with nexti.

gdb> nexti

- After some steps, we see that the program calls atoi function and crash after that Segmentation fault.

- We started the program again with an argument, we found that the program compare the returned value from atoi to an value 0x1a7=423 and after that the program lunch a new shell using execv func.

0x08048ed9 <+25>:	cmp    eax,0x1a7
[...]
0x08048f51 <+145>:	call   0x8054640 <execv>

- We tried to run the program with 423 as argument.

- Finally, we entered the shell as level1 user and we got the flag.

$> cat /home/user/level1/.pass
